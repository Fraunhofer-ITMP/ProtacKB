# ProtacKB
Welcome to ProtacKB GitHub!!

ProtacKB is a knowledge graph (KG) built for ProxiDrugs, a project aimed at developing new class of proximity-induced drugs that allow targeted degradation of disease-associated proteins. 

Currently, ProtacKB uses ProtacDB, ProtacPEDIA and PubChem as main sources of protacs. Additionally, the KG is enrinched with knowledge from ubinet 2.0, DrugCentral and DisGeNET.
