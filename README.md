# ProtacKB
Welcome to ProtacKB GitHub!!

ProtacKB is a knowledge graph (KG) built for ProxiDrugs, a project aimed at developing new class of proximity-induced drugs that allow targeted degradation of disease-associated proteins. 

Currently, ProtacKB uses ProtacDB, ProtacPEDIA and PubChem as main sources of protacs. Additionally, the KG is enrinched with knowledge from ubinet 2.0, DrugCentral and DisGeNET.

The KG is visualized on Neo4j and we will provide access to it very soon.
